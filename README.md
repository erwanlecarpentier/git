# l2f-sim
Stand-alone simulator for the "Learning To Fly" project

This project was developed at ISAE-Supaero by a team of the DISC department
(Complex System Engineering Department). The goal is to provide a simple,
efficient, stand-alone library, for the simulation of the flight dynamics of an 
autonomous glider within convective soaring conditions and the development of
Reinforcement Learning control algorithms. The code hosted here contains the 
library and a few demonstration tools allowing to simulate different controls 
strategies.

# Makefile commands:

Clean:
-make clean (remove executables and data files)
-make clean_exe (remove executables)
-make clean_dat (remove data files)

Compile and run:

# Principle (design patterns) of the L2F simulator

* L2F simulations
A L2F simulation is primarily defined via the 'L2F::simulation' class.
This class is defined in the src directory '/L2Fsim'.
It comprises pointers to a 'L2F::flight_zone', a 'L2F::aircraft', a 'L2F::pilot'
and a 'L2F::stepper'.
Each of these classes is defined in the homonym respective directories.
These classes are interface classes: they define the basic attributes 
and methods that are called by the simulation. In practice, they need to be 
refined by inheritance in order to define instantiable classes, such as, for
example :
- L2F::beeler_glider for L2F::aircraft
- L2F::flat_thermal_soaring_zone for L2F::flight_zone
- L2F::euler_integrator for L2F::stepper
- L2F::passive_pilot for L2F::pilot

* Using the library
Example provided in the 'demo/main.cpp' file

* Extending the library
The library can be extended by defining new aircrafts, new steppers, new pilots
or new flight zones. To do so, create your own classes that inherits from the 
L2F::aircraft, L2F::stepper, L2F::pilot or L2F::flight_zone basic classes (or
any of the already defined classes in the respective directories). Afterwards
one can start ones implementation with the constraint that the pure virtual
inherited methods necessarily have to be implemented.
